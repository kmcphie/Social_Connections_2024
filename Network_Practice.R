# The first step in building the network is to create an igraph object. 
# The d variable takes the edges connecting the actor nodes that are held in the
# movies dataframe that was created, the vertices variable takes the actor nodes
# that are listed in the actors dataframe.

# The vertices variable requires one column of node identifiers, which in this 
# case are the actorsâ€™ names. The d argument requires a dataframe in two columns
# of connections between vertice identifiers.
