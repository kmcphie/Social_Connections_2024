Include  model  that  supplements overall points made in the project
(Could do satisfaction ~ various other factors)
Analysis of probability
Show actual regression and table output ideally, but at least description

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(rstanarm)
```

```{r}
responses_clean$gap_yeardummy <- 0 

responses_clean$gap_yeardummy[which(responses_clean$gap_year == "Yes")] <- 1
```

```{r}
fit <- stan_glm(gap_yeardummy ~ p1_closeness + gender + race,
                data = responses_clean,
                refresh = 0,
                family = binomial())


```


```{r}
ggplot(responses_clean, aes(x = group_size)) +
geom_density()

stan_glm(group_size ~ gender + gap_year + living + location,
         data = responses_clean,
         refresh = 0,
         family = poisson())
```
