# TODO
 
### Publicize Survey
* Cross-check emails of people who have responded with all emails we have
* Print out flyers to put in the dining halls?
* Other pubbing ideas?

### Write-up
* Better project intro
* Justification for survey questions
* Bios (do we want to change the format?)
 
### The Social Web
* Assigning people random IDs in such a way that we can figure out who of the 
four people a given person put also put them
* Figuring out how to make the fancy interactive graph (is there a better 
package to use or is the same one as last year good?)
 
### Cleaning the Data
* Deciding how to represent race (see the graph we have now for an example)
* Removing the weird answers like "idk bro"
 
### Analyzing the Data
 * What interesting trends are already starting to emerge that we could highlight?
 
### Most Connected Individuals
* Figuring how many "steps" away any two freshmen are from each other
* Are there certain people in the middle who are especially well-connected?
* Do these most well-connected people match who people think are the most 
well-connected?
