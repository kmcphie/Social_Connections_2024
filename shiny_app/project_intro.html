    <h4><b>Purpose of Our Research</b></h4>
    <p>How do we become friends with the people we are friends with? Are the friends we make truly representative of our interests or are they actually determined by uncontrollable factors like the dorms we live in, our extracurriculars, our race, and where we come from? In seeking to answer this question and others like it, we mapped and analyzed the literal social network of the Harvard Class of 2024.</p>
    <p>Jeremiah Kim conducted <a href = "https://jeremiah-kim.shinyapps.io/Social_Connections/">a very similar project</a> last year, and building off of his team's findings, we were particularly interested to see how first-years were forming connections and staying connected with each other in this unprecedented time shaped by the COVID-19 pandemic. We were curious to see what significant differences might be noticable between this semester and the fall semester last year.</p>
  <h4><b>Collecting Data</b></h4>
  <p>We sent out a survey to members of the Harvard Class of 2024 (first-years) to gather the data for our project. We scraped emails from the Harvard face book to contact first-years and also made use of class Facebook and Instagram pages, Slack channels, GroupMe chats, and other social media forums to publicize the survey.</p>

    <h4><b>Respondents</b></h4>
    <p>Approximately 400 first-years filled out the survey. There are approximately 1600 students in a Harvard class, but it's important to note that this number would be lower for the Class of 2024 specifically because approximately 20% of the class decided to take a gap year. The increased number of students interested in gap years was presumably evidence of many graduating seniors' wanting to delay enrollement in the hopes of getting a more typical college experience in a year when things might be closer to the old normal. Of the first-years who filled out the survey, this interactive graph shows the distribution of respondents with  regard to each the demographic categories we asked about.</p>
