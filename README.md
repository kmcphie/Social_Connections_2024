# Social Connectedness in the Harvard Class of 2024
### A final project for [Gov 50: Data](https://www.davidkane.info/files/gov_50_fall_2020.html) at Harvard College

### Project Summary
How do we become friends with the people we are friends with? Are the friends we make truly representative of our interests or are they actually determined by uncontrollable factors like the dorms we live in, our extracurriculars, our race, and where we come from? In seeking to answer this question and others like it, we mapped and analyzed the literal social network of the Harvard Class of 2024.
Jeremiah Kim conducted [a very similar project]("https://jeremiah-kim.shinyapps.io/Social_Connections) last year, and building off of his team's findings, we were particularly interested to see how first-years were forming connections and staying connected with each other in this unprecedented time shaped by the COVID-19 pandemic. We were curious to see what significant differences might be noticable between this semester and the fall semester last year.
