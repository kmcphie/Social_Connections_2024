# Social Connectedness in the Harvard Class of 2024
### A final project for [Gov 50: Data](https://www.davidkane.info/files/gov_50_fall_2020.html) at Harvard College

### Project Summary
How has COVID-19 affected college first-years' social connectedness? How has social distancing changed the way relationships are formed and maintained? During a time typically filled with immense socialization, college first-years in 2020 have had a very different experience. In this project, we aimed to learn more about the unique freshman experience of the Class of 2024 by looking at the means by which first-year students at Harvard formed connections and stayed connected with each other. In doing so, we mapped the literal web of social connections in the Class of 2024 and analyzed aspects of this social network.
