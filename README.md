# Social Connectedness in the Harvard Class of 2024
### A final project for [Gov 50: Data](https://www.davidkane.info/files/gov_50_fall_2020.html) at Harvard College

### Project Summary
How do we become friends with the people we are friends with? Are the friends we make truly representative of our interests or are they actually determined by uncontrollable factors like the dorms we live in, our extracurriculars, our race, and where we come from?
In seeking to answer this question and others like it, we mapped and analyzed the literal social network of the Harvard Class of 2024. We were interested to see how Harvard first-years formed social connections during this unprecedented year in particular, looking at the means by which they formed connections and stayed connected with each other, the literal web of social connections in the Class of 2024, comparing the average level of connectedness to the average level of connectedness from last year, and so on.
